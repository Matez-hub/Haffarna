      It’s widely known that dogs are pack animals by nature, genetically wired to be social and have others around them at all times. Some have even been bred to serve as working dogs, toiling side by side with their humans each day. But when humans or other dogs aren’t around, do they actually get lonely?
      “I don’t think we ever really know for sure, because we can’t ask them,” says Michelle Mullins, a certified dog behavior consultant who owns Honest to Dog. “But there are certainly some behaviors that would lead us to think they are feeling the feelings of loneliness or feelings that come along with loneliness.”</p>
    <p class="cat_text"> <strong>So, how long can a cat be home alone without their favorite people?</strong> It really depends on the cat. Most adult cats do well by themselves for the length of a typical workday, eight to 10 hours, but cats can still experience loneliness during this time frame. Mischievous kittens, senior cats that need extra attention, cats with behavioral concerns or medical issues and any cat with special circumstances, for example, require more attention throughout the day and will benefit from at least one check-in per day. It's never a good idea to leave your cat home for days or weeks at a time, even if you leave out food, water and toys. Not only will this separation increase loneliness and boredom, but it can also lead to an increase in physical and behavioral problems.</p>
